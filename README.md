# DIA_QC_report

The `dia_qc` script contains several sub-commands to generate QC and batch reports from DIA proteomics data. Reports from 1 or more Skyline documents are combined into a single sqlite database which is modified or read by subsequent commands.

To see all the available sub-commands run: `dia_qc -h`

```
usage: dia_qc <command> [<args>]

Available commands:
   parse                Generate QC and batch correction database from Skyline reports.
   metadata_convert     Convert metadata annotations to specified file format.
   normalize            Perform DirectLFQ or median normalization on batch database.
   qc_qmd               Generate QC qmd report.
   batch_rmd            Generate batch correction rmd report.
   export_gene_matrix   Export PDC gene tables from batch database.
   db_export            Export selected table(s) from batch/qc database.

## Installation

Clone the repository

```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/ajmaurais/DIA_QC_report
```

The python scripts in DIA_QC_report are bundled into a package which can be installed with pip.

```
cd DIA_QC_report
pip install .
```

In order to render the batch Rmarkdown report, you also need to install the R package in the `rDIAUtils` sub-repository.

```
cd DIA_QC_report/rDIAUtils
Rscript -e 'install.packages(".", type="source", repo=NULL)'
```

## Parsing Skyline reports

The `parse` sub-command is used to combine .tsv reports exported from one or more Skyline documents into a sqlite database which is used in all subsequent steps. `parse` requires a precursor level and replicate level report from each Skyline document. The templates for both reports are in the `resources` subdirectory.

</details>

To create a new database:

```
dia_qc parse --projectName <document_1> <document_1_replicate_quality.tsv> <document_1_precursor_quality.tsv> 
```

To add reports from additional documents to an existing database add the `--overwriteMode=append` flag:

```
dia_qc parse --projectName <document_2> --overwriteMode=append <document_2_replicate_quality.tsv> <document_2_precursor_quality.tsv> 
```

## Normalzation

The `normalize` sub-command performs median normalization at the precursor level and [DirectLFQ](https://github.com/MannLabs/directlfq) normalization at the protein level. The normalized values are written directly to the database. The script modifies the database in place by modifying the `normalizedArea` column in the `precursors` table and the `normalizedAbundance` column in the `proteinQuants` table.

```
dia_qc normalize data.db3
```

## QC report

Generate qmd file

```
dia_qc qc_qmd --addStdProtein 'sp|P00924|ENO1_YEAST' data.db3
```

Render qmd to html

```
quarto render qc_report.qmd --to html
```

## Batch correction report

Generate rmd file

```
dia_qc batch_rmd data.db3
```

Render rmd to html

```
Rscript -e 'rmarkdown::render("bc_report.rmd")'
```

## Other sub-commands

### Export databse tables to tsv file(s).

The `db_export` sub-command is used to export precursor, protein, or metadate tables from the batch/qc database to a tsv file.

```
dia_qc db_export data.db3
```

### Convert between metadata formats

The `metadata_conver` sub-command is used to interconvert between all the metadata file formats which are supported by `dia_qc parse`.

Convert tsv to json

```
dia_qc metadata_convert -o json <metadata_tsv>
```

Convert tsv to Skyline annotation csv

```
dia_qc metadata_convert -o skyline <metadata_tsv>
```

Convert Skyline annotation csv to tsv

```
dia_qc metadata_convert -o tsv <annotation_csv>
```
